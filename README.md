# Dynamic-Shops-Mapping-Tool

Description

The shoppmaper is a python script that organizes data. It organizes and outputs data based prefixes, it is handy when working with shops. I used BTA as an example for this upload. Look inside the shopmapper folder and you'll have an idea of its purpose. It finds all the CSV lists a LRM 20 is assigned to and outputs that info in a single text files. The output files are organized by file name prefixes.


How to Use

-Extract the files into the DynamicShops folder.
-Open Command Prompt type python  *YOURCOMPLETEPATHTOFOLDER*\DynamicShops\shopmapper.py
-The data will be output to the shopmapper folder in a txt
